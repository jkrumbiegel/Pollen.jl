# Pollen.jl

A document generation system based on tree rewriting built for interactive work.

**Note**: The documentation for this package is still very much a work in progress. However, Pollen.jl already powers the documentation of some packages like [FastAI.jl](https://fluxml.ai/FastAI.jl/dev/i).

## Getting started

First, find out [how to install Pollen](docs/howto/install.md) and then start by using it to document your own Julia package.

## Features

- format-agnostic document representation
- use Markdown, Julia files and Jupyter notebooks as input documents
- incremental, live reload; only rebuilds what you changed
- code execution
- automatic references
- pluggable extension system; only use the features you want
