# Pollen.jl

A document generation system based on tree rewriting built for interactive work.

**Note**: The documentation for this package is still a work in progress and while Pollen.jl already powers the documentation of some packages like [FastAI.jl](https://fluxml.ai/FastAI.jl/dev/i), it is not as stable or mature as other solutions like [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl).

## Getting started

First, find out [how to install Pollen](docs/howto/install.md) and then [how to setup package documentation](docs/tutorials/setup.md).
